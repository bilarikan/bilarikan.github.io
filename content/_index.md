I build systems behind learning, enablement and performance measurement. From learning experiences to in-product experiences and the key results they enable. When I’m not architecting business outcomes, I’m experimenting at the edges: building spider bot with my daughter, building local AI stacks on my homelab, and rethinking early education through tools like Obsidian and Live AI Agents.
