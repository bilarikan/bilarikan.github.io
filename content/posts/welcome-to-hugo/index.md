This is the first post after moving `bil.arikan.ca` from Astro to Hugo.

The migration matters, but the stack is not the goal. The goal is to have a stable space where I can run experiments, document outcomes, and improve my practice over time.

## Goal

In this site, I am aiming to:

1. Develop ideas on learning design and performance support.
2. Build better Markdown-first knowledge workflows.
3. Practice pair-programming with AI agents in practical tasks.
4. Keep a long-term record in a space I fully own.

## Current approach

I am using a simple cycle: identify a problem, prototype, test, and capture what changed.

{{< mermaid >}}
flowchart TD
  A[Observe a problem] --> B[Write a short note]
  B --> C[Prototype with code or content]
  C --> D[Pair-program with an AI agent]
  D --> E[Refine with human judgment]
  E --> F[Publish and iterate]
{{< /mermaid >}}

In this flow, AI helps with speed, but decisions stay human. I use agents to draft, test, and check; then I edit for clarity and intent.

## Current skill focus

Right now, my focus is strongest on practical skills that improve delivery speed and decision quality in real projects.

- Learning architecture and performance support design
- Markdown-based knowledge management workflows
- Hugo workflow and static publishing operations
- Analytics and measurement thinking
- Pair-programming with AI agents for prototyping and validation

## What I will publish here

Most posts will fall into one of these categories:

1. Working notes from experiments.
2. Practical guides I can reuse.
3. Reflections on what worked, what failed, and what I changed next.

For now, the standard is usefulness over polish. If a post helps me make better decisions in the next iteration, it has done its job.

## Next step

My next focus is to keep tightening the loop between writing, prototyping, and measurement, especially in projects where learning design and software workflow overlap.
