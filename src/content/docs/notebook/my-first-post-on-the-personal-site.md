## First Post: starting the personal site

The impulse to create this space has been coming to me for a while. Now feels like the right time to start it. The reasons are mostly revolving around learning, practice, and the want for privately maintained intellectual space:

### A Personal Repository for Evolving Thoughts

I've felt the growing need for a place to develop and curate thoughts about topics. This includes topics spanning learning methodologies, technology trends, approaches to performance measurement, and strategies for learning performance data collection. 

### Deepening Astro and Static Site Workflow Mastery

This project is a deliberate exercise in solidifying my skills with the Astro web framework and wering with markdown file formats in generla. I want to immerse myself further in the practicalities of the static site generation (SSG) workflow, truly understanding the interplay of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Markdown in a real-world context.

### Cultivating Markdown Fluency for Knowledge Management

My exploration of Obsidian and the slip-box (Zettelkasten) method for ideation and documentation necessitates stronger Markdown proficiency. Creating content directly in Markdown here will reinforce this skill, making it a natural extension of my broader knowledge management practices. This site will act as an additional reinforcement.

### A Space Beyond Social Feeds

While social platforms offer reach, they often come with inherent limitationsâ€”ephemeral content, algorithmic curation, and a sense of not truly owning the content. I wan a personally-led, unfiltered space to develop thoughts without external pressures or the noise of a given platform's engagement mechanisms.


So, this is the baseline. I anticipate the site will  grow and shift focus as my interests and priorities change.
